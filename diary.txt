I'm currently having a panic attack, maybe not that serious but I don't feel good. It seems that everything I'm doing is slowly getting out of control. I'm not in control of myself. And the worst thing is that I cannot tell my parents about this. I know they will just freak out and force me to rot in this god-forsaken place. I need to get out of here, get out of this dump. Network today is not too good either, even though my intension is that I need to rely on internet as little as possible so it shouldn't bother me that much.

It's like doing something you have never done before. You have no idea what would happen next. You are like driving a car at an insane high speed, and you are barely able to control the car. It's swinging. It cannot hold much longer. It's going to break. You know you will break, and pretty much all you can do is waiting. Waiting for yourself to die, to lose control.

I need to get some BZDs. My parents will suspect this so I really need to pick a good timing. Or rather, I just casually go to there and swallow like 6 pills like nothing terribly happened.
